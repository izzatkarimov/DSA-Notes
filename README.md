<summary>Arrays</summary>

`What is Data Structure?`
- Data Structure is a way of structuring data inside of RAM of a computer.

`How do ew store an array in RAM?`
- RAM is measured in bytes. One byte is 8 bits. A bit can be thought of as a position that can store a digit, which has to be either 0 or 1.

`NOTE!`
- Arrays are always stored contiguously in RAM, meaning that they are stored one next to another (there is nothing between them.

`NOTE!`
- Static arrays are Fixed arrays. The biggest limitation of Static Arrays is that we cannot add / delete elements after creation. Technically, we can remove a value, but removing here only means overriding. We cannot actaully delete the value in memory. But, we can override by putting, let's say, 0 in the index location of it.

`Big O Time Complexity of Static Arrays Operations`

| Operation  | Big O Time | 
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Read / Write i-th element  | O(1)  |
| Insert / Remove End | O(1)  |
| Insert Middle | O(n)  |
| Remove Middle  | O(n)  |

`NOTE!`
- In Python and JavaScript, Dynamic Arrays are the default. In Java, we can use an Array List, and in C++, we can use a Vector.

`What is Amortized Time Complexity?`
- Amortized Time Complexity

<summary>Introduction to Algorithms</summary>

`What is an Algorithm`
- An Algorithm is a set of steps or instructions for completing a certain task. For example, a recipe is an algorithm. To-Do List for a Morning Routine is an algorithm. However, in the context of Computer Science, an algorithm more specifically means a set a steps a program takes to finish a certain task.

`Time Complexity`
- Time Complexity is a measure of how long it takes the algorithm to run.

`Space Complexity`
- Space Complexity deals with the amount of memory taken up on the computer.

`Balance between Time & Space Complexity`
- A good algorithm needs to balance between Time and Space Complexity to be useful. For example, you can have a very fast algorithm but it may not matter if the algorithm consumes more memory than you have available.

`Running Time of an Algorithm`
- How long the algorithm runs for a given set of values until the output is called The Running Time or The Running Time of an Algorithm and is used to define Time Complexity.

`Linear Search (Sequential Search)`
- Linear Search is a sequential searching algorithm where we start from one end and check every element of the list until the desired element is found. It is the simplest searching algorithm.

`Binary Search (Hald Interval Search)`
- Binary Search is a searching algorithm for finding an element's position in a sorted way. In this approach, the element is always searched in the middle of a portion of an array. Binary Search can be implemented only on a sorted list of items. If the elements are not sorted already, we need to sort them first.

`Guidelines for defiing an Algorithm:`
  - The steps in the Algorithm need to be in a specific order.
  - The steps also need to be distinct.
  - The algorithm should produce a result.
  - The algorithm should complete in a finite amount of time.
